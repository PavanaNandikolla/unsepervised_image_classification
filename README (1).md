# Unsupervised-Image-Classification
Unsupervised image classification is a type of image analysis where the goal is to group or categorize pixels within an image without the use of labeled training data. Unlike supervised classification, where the algorithm is trained on labeled examples, unsupervised classification does not require prior knowledge of class labels. 
Instead, it identifies patterns or structures within the data and groups similar pixels together based on their inherent similarities.
## Principal Component Analysis
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a dimensionality reduction technique commonly used in data analysis and machine learning. It is one of the projected dimensionality reduction technique 
It is particularly useful for reducing the number of features in a dataset while preserving as much of the original variability as possible. 
PCA achieves this by transforming the data into a new set of uncorrelated variables, known as principal components, which are linear combinations of the original features.

# VGG 16
VGG16 is a deep convolutional neural network architecture that was proposed by the Visual Geometry Group (VGG) at the University of Oxford. It gained significant attention and popularity for its simplicity and strong performance on image classification tasks. 
The "16" in VGG16 refers to the 16 weight layers in the network. 
VGG16 consists of 16 convolutional and fully connected layers. The architecture is characterized by the repeated use of small 3x3 convolutional filters, which allows the network to learn hierarchical features.

# K Means
K-Means is a popular unsupervised machine learning algorithm used for clustering, which is the process of grouping similar data points together. The algorithm aims to partition a dataset into 'k' distinct, non-overlapping subgroups or clusters. Each data point belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean, and the mean is calculated as the centroid of all the points in the cluster. 
K-Means is widely used for various applications, including image segmentation, customer segmentation, and anomaly detection.

# DBSCAN

Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) is a clustering algorithm commonly used in machine learning and data mining. 
Unlike K-Means, DBSCAN does not require specifying the number of clusters beforehand and can identify clusters of arbitrary shapes. It works by grouping together data points that are close to each other in terms of density.
